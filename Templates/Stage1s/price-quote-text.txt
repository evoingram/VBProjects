Hello there,

I am writing this e-mail to give you a price quote and a couple of extra details about our work.

Now, if you are fine with the transcript being only electronically delivered to you, with the court receiving the required electronic and hard copies, then we offer the following page rates for 15 or more hours of audio: 
 
•  30 calendar-day turnaround, $3.10/page
•  14 calendar-day turnaround, $3.70/page
•  07 calendar-day turnaround, $4.30/page
•  03 calendar-day turnaround, $4.70/page
 
For everything else, we offer the following page rates:

•  30 calendar-day turnaround, $3.50/page
•  14 calendar-day turnaround, $4.10/page
•  07 calendar-day turnaround, $4.70/page
•  03 calendar-day turnaround, $5.30/page
•  same day/overnight turnaround, $5.95/page


So for <Audiolength> hours at 45 pages per audio hour, you’d be looking at <PageCount> pages approximately and the following estimates for the rates I just listed above:
 
•  30 calendar-day turnaround, $<Subtotal1>
•  14 calendar-day turnaround, $<Subtotal1>
•  07 calendar-day turnaround, $<Subtotal1>
•  03 calendar-day turnaround, $<Subtotal1>

In terms of file transmission, we have a website where you can upload it or we can order it from the court on your behalf and there may or may not be an additional charge for that, depending on the jurisdiction (most places are free, some aren't).

A list of what is included in our rates may be found at https://www.aquoco.co/Court-Transcription.html.  Our rates include:

•	Velobound 28-lb paper copies (unless electronic only)
•	Color, custom weather-proof labeled CD of your transcript + audio where allowed (unless electronic only)
•	Hyperlinked headings & tables of content
•	Hyperlinked case law & authorities where possible (.gov websites or freely publicly accessible websites with a long history)
•	Table of authorities
•	Condensed version, your choice of 2/page or 4/page
•	“working” copy, Word version where you can use all the regular features of Word with the transcript such highlight and bold.
