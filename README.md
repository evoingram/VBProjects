In Progress:  Porting this online.
/Database/ holds all the relevant database code.<br><br>

* Developed using Visual Basic for Applications, Microsoft Access, and MySQL
* Company database for used for transcript production and management
* Saved an average of 15 to 20 hours per week
* Generates 25 to 30 different documents automatically such as price quotes, invoices, cover pages, indexes, and others
* Manages schedule and production workflow
* Auto-imports e-mails from Outlook
* Automatically hyperlinks authority within transcripts via CourtListener API
* Manipulates PDFs to auto-generate bookmarks and create different transcript versions
* Tracks communication and document history of each transcript order
* Manages and plays audio and reporter notes
* Integrated with Office, Acrobat, and WinSCP libraries and several APIs such as CourtListener, Wunderlist, PayPal, OneNote, and others

This database has been created with concepts from GTD incorporated into its workflow. It uses a strict folder system developed by me to manage all of the related files it deals with.
<br><br>
There is also a working speech recognition component that I have never used because I need something more robust than PocketSphinx; it will do things at the click of a button like record the audio in the proper format, complete the speech recognition, and auto-feed the engine audio & transcripts to make it more accurate. It formats court transcripts into an engine-readable format. A chunk of it was done using batch files, but comes out of VBA & starts from clicking an Access form button.
